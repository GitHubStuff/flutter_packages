Minimal Flutter App

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

It uses:

- flutter_localizations
- flutter_extras
- theme_manager
- cupertino_icons
- flutter_bloc
- flutter_modular
- intl

It is setup for localizations with just edits to *lib/ln10n/app_en.arb /lib/ln10n/app_es.arb*

(see also l10n.yaml that defines the l10n localization)

ref:

[Flutter localizations](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization) Details the localization process

*theme_manager* allows for switching of light/dark themes, based on the platform brightness, or user preferred brightness independent of the platform.

## Final note

Be kind to each other!
